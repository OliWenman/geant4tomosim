/*
A class assigned to a AbsorptionDetectors G4LogicalVolume. Inherits 
from Geant4's G4SenstiveDetector class which is used to determines
the process taken when a particle is detected.

Each pixel is assigned a copy number, data is stored as a 1D vector.
Converted to 2D projection on python side via numpy.shape method.
