//A class that inherits from SampleDescription, Boolean_Sample is used to
//extend its ability to make more complicated boolean solids by joining
//and subtracting geometry away from other solids. Therefore it needs
//additional attributes and methods to know which solids to use as well as
//at what rotation and position to subtract the solids away from each other.
