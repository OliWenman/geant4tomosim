/physics/EM/PhotoElectricEffect true
/physics/EM/ComptonScattering false	
/physics/EM/RayleighScattering false
/physics/EM/Fluorescence false

#Data Settings
/data/Seed 0
/data/bins 10			#(Choose the number of bins you would like the energy of the photons to be split into for the detectors to detector)

#Gun Settings
/gun/setEnergy 25 keV		#(Set the initial energy of the monochromatic X-ray beam)
/gun/setBeamWidth 2.5 mm #000013 mm		#(Set the beam width)
/gun/setBeamHeight 2.1 mm			#(Set the beam height)

#World Settings
/world/size 20 2.55 2.1 mm		#(Set the world size, everything must be inside of it)
/world/visualization false	#(Wrtie data as a HepRepFile to be viewed later in HepRApp Data Browser. WARNING: Change to false for long simulations)
