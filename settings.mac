#Seed settings 
/run/seed 0		#(For the seed, 0 is random, input own number for your own seed)
/run/print false			#(If you want to print hit image information at the end of each run NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ACTUAL SIMULATIONS, more of a debugging tool to check it's working.)

#Data Settings
/data/Seed 0
/data/Energy false
/data/bins 5			#(Choose the number of bins you would like the energy of the photons to be split into for the detectors to detector)
/data/TextFile true		#(Choose if you would like the data to be saved into a textfile)
/data/HDF5File true
/data/NumberOfImages 5		#(Choose the number of images you would like to have for the simulation. Rotates target by dTheta between each run. dTheta = 180*deg/NumberOfImages)
/data/NumberOfPhotons 500	#(Choose the number of photons to be fired at the target)

#Gun Settings
/gun/setEnergy 25 keV		#(Set the initial energy of the monochromatic X-ray beam)
/gun/setBeamWidth 0.5 mm #000013 mm		#(Set the beam width)
/gun/setBeamHeight 0.5 mm			#(Set the beam height)

#World Settings
#8 <= for x gives no warnings??
/world/size 20 2.55 2.1 mm		#(Set the world size, everything must be inside of it)
/world/visualization true	#(Wrtie data as a HepRepFile to be viewed later in HepRApp Data Browser. WARNING: Change to false for long simulations)
