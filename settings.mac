#Settings for the simulation

/physics/addPhysics EMStandardPhysics	#(Choose the Physics Package you want to include, refer to the README for details)

#Seed settings 
/run/seed 0		#(For the seed, 0 is random, input own number for your own seed)
/run/print true 	#(If you want to print hit image information at the end of each run)

#Data Settings
