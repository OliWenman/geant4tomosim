#Settings for the simulation

/physics/addPhysics EMStandardPhysics	#(Choose the Physics Package you want to include, refer to the README for details)

#Seed settings 
/run/seed 0		#(For the seed, 0 is random, input own number for your own seed)
/run/print false    	#(If you want to print hit image information at the end of each run)

#Data Settings
/data/Visualization false	#(Wrtie data as a HepRepFile to be viewed later in HepRApp Data Browser. WARNING: Change to false for long simulations)
/data/TextFile true		#(Choose if you would like the data to be saved into a textfile)
/data/bins 10			#(Choose the number of bins you would like the energy of the photons to be split into for the detectors)
/data/NumberOfImages 10		#(Choose the number of images you would like to have for the simulation. Rotates target by dTheta between each run. dTheta = 180*deg/NumberOfImages)
/data/NumberOfPhotons 100	#(Choose the number of photons to be fired at the target)

#Gun Settings
