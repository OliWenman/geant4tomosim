Information on how to use this simulation.

Below is a list of avaliable physics packages that are optimised for different needs. In "settings.mac", the command /physics/addPhysics PhysicsSetting , where PhysicsSetting is the name of the physics package, allows you to change the simulation to adopt the physic package you need. Simply change the command to the title of any of the below options. For example, "/physics/addPhysics EmLivermorePhysics".
